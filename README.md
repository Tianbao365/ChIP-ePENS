# ChIP-ePENS
ChIP-exo is a new emerging novel protocol in which a lambda exonuclease is introduced into the ChIP system (see &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-exo>). This exonuclease degrades unbound double-stranded DNA in 5′-3′ direction, to within a few nucleotides of the protein binding site, then the exonuclease-treated 5′-ends (or exo-5’-ends) are subjective to sequencing, and high concentration of exo-5’-ends at one location would represent a protein protected boundary that usually termed as “border” in ChIP-exo analysis. This new technique greatly increases the resolution of binding sites to single base pair. Here, in our previous studies, we have modified the protocol as ChIP-ePENS (ChIP-exo paired-ends sequencing, see the following figure), in which we not only collects exonuclease-treated 5’-end (exo-5’-end) but also sonicated 3’-end (son-3’-end) together.
